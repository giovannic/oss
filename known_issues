  Need to fix the openss -offline command error checking to look for missing arguments
  and give better error messages (jeg)

  Need to update offline collectors to allow changing the collector parameters.
  e.g. sampling_rate, papi threshhold, papi events, etc etc etc...

  The mrnet instrumentor is not working on zeus.llnl.gov and other
  linux systems do to a kernel patch related to utrace.
  Matt Legendre is working on this. From Matt:
  ***
  The problem starts when we attach to a process that is already in a stopped
  state.  Every time we call wait() on such a process it immediately returns
  with a report that the process recieved a signal 0. I would have expected
  the call to wait() to block until an actual signal or event was recieved
  (likely from a different process than the stopped one).
  ***
  (jeg) tried Matts patch, but it causes problems on all the systems (jeg) tried
  it on and didn't seem to fix the problem on zeus.  First (jeg) had to upgrade to the
  latest dyninst release tarball, update the patch list and test that on a few systems.
  (6-23-80-jeg)

  (jeg) - We now can create mpi jobs with Matt's new fix/patch but we hang in the cli on 
  mimimal number of ranked processes.  Looks like a CLI threading issue.
------------------------------------------------------

- 6-10-2008
  Address overlap (seen on yellowrail and elsewhere) is causing the
  performance metrics for those functions to be 2,3,4 times larger for
  functions where overlap occurs. Matt Legendre notes that this is due
  to shared code (Multiple functions look to be sharing an exit block.
  If you treat functions as ranges, this will probably lead to confusion.)
  This is not seen with offline where we lookup function and statements
  via sample addresses and therefore map to the exact function that the
  address is contained in.
  ***
  We have received information from Matt along with a patch that gives us
  some support for finding out which functions overlap at a particualar
  address.  Bill has outlined where the code must be changed in openss
  to address this issue. 
  (6-23-80-jeg)
  ***
  A number of these issues have been addressed with changes to the openss SymbolTable code.
  i.e. We are getting decent metric values.  Bill Hachfeld has a beta version of code
  to handle the remaining issues with non-contiguous functions.  That code is not integrated
  and is currently being tested as of 7-29-2008.

  The mrnet instrumentor has sporadic hangs on YellowRail (and possibly
  other cluster based systems).  Jim (and Don) have been working on the
  cli thread locking.  Jim has some fixes in progress and is still
  pursing the issue.
  ***
  I'm at an impasse on this.  I can't seem to figure out what is causing
  us to seemingly be stuck in fgets on yellowrail's backend nodes.
  Because of the issues on llnl machines and I can't run on catalyst 
  because openmpi and mpich don't seem to be working there - I can't
  tell if the issue is yellowrail specific.

  Running the MRNet version of openss on alc.llnl.gov reveals a case where
  dyninst reports that the srun process has terminated but it hasn't.
  No sign of the srun process exiting in the dyninst signal trace, but
  one of srun's threads is terminating just before O|SS reports the process
  as exiting. Could O|SS be mixing up a thread deletion event for a
  process deletion?
  ***
  I don't believe this is O|SS mixing up a thread deletion.  It appears,
  according to Matt's interpertation of the traces I sent him that the
  server/backend seems to be farther along than the client thinks.  Our
  openss client is waiting for the create process to complete.  Matt says
  dyninst is past that stage??
  (6-23-80-jeg)

  Matt has a trace that shows dyninst issuing an assert during MPI creation
  on alc.

  Need to automate creation of mrnet topology file for clusters.
  This should be similar to how site.py is modified for starting remote
  dpcld daemons for the dpcl instrumentor. One proposed method would
  be to move any existing topology file to a backup, create an new
  topology file with the pid of the current openss process in it's name,
  set the MRENT topology envvironment to the new file and proceed.
  Sam Gutierrez at LANL is working on this.
  ***
  Jim sent out an email with some script examples for automating this
  on LLNL's zeus system.

  The OPENSS_RAWDATA_DIR defaults to /tmp for instrumentors that use
  the runtime/fileio to write performance data (mrnet and offline).
  For cluster systems this should default to the parallel file system
  recommended for that cluster.  It should further be appended to use
  the users account name.  e.g. raw data should be written to
  $OPENSS_RAWDATA_DIR/$USERNAME.  This impacts the ossrun.in script,
  the init.py RunOfflineExp method, and the framework/mrnet/Watcher code.
  ***
  The RunOfflineExp python code in init.py now adds the users id to the
  default OPENSS_RAWDATA_DIR.  This works for the openss -offline option as well.
  e.g. For the python script the default is /tmp/$USER/offline-oss.
  TODO: update ossrun and watcher to do same. i.e. default to /tmp/$USER/offline-oss
  for ossrun and /tmp/$USER for the mrnet watcher.
  (7-29-2008 -dpm)
  ***
  The online code is the only peice remaing that needs to follow.
  i.e. /tmp/$USER/online-oss and use $OPENSS_RAWDATA_DIR/online-oss
  internally with in the watcher code.  (1-22-2010 -dpm)

  The offline collector runtimes need a method to record the rank id
  of mpi processes.  This is availble to the mpi and mpit collectors
  but is not available in general to the other collectors.  This will
  require adding a rank field to openss_expinfo blobs.
  ***
  This work is in progress. Will require a small dso that overrides MPI_Init
  and records the mpi rank to the openss-info rawdata file for all collectors
  other than the mpi, mpit, and mpiotf collectors.  The mpi, and mpit collectors
  will need to record and send the rank info to the openss-info rawdata file too.
  (7-29-2008 -dpm)
  ***
  This work is complete. Using libmonitor's code for accessing rank
  information in all the collectors.
--------------------------------------------------------

  The symboltables created for offline experiments need to include the
  first statement for any function found with sampled address data even
  if the first statement was not one of the samples.  This is needed by
  various gui (source file focus events) and cli (list -v src) commands.
  (7-29-2008 -dpm -fixed)
--------------------------------------------------------

- I/O collector doesn't support "-v" statements
  (error while double click on source during stacktrace)

* (dpm) Currently the tool does not support -v Statements for
  any of the tracing experiments (io,iot,mpi,mpit).
  Tracing experiments do not typically contain a sample address
  at an abritray line/address with in a function.
  The fix is to disable adding -v Statements to any command line
  generated by the GUI for tracing experiments.
  This does raise the issue on how to hightlight the lines in
  the user source (SourcePanel) where a trace occured.

- When displaying icons for various metrics (e.g. -V Statements),
  the icons displayed should match those available to a particular
  experiment. For example, the trace experiments do not support
  -v Statements and should not present that option as an icon.
--------------------------------------------------------

* Clicking on a entry in a stacktrace in the StatsPanel does
  not focus the SourcePanel on the correct line for the event
  but rather on the first line of the enclosing function.

* (dpm) This is now fixed by having the GUI compute the
   lineNumber to focus on by using the Callstak element Value
   data rather than the getDefinitions data.
--------------------------------------------------------

* (jeg) Bad times in stack trace data (usertime, I/O, ...)
   The fix went into the CLI, but Dave W. thinks this might
   be a framework issue.
--------------------------------------------------------

* (jeg) Disable full path view didn't work during tutorial
   Jim investigated and this appears to be working in his
   version.
--------------------------------------------------------

* MPI startup broken
        - Jim's system: can't execute
        - LLNL: - can't resume MPI job after attach
                  (test debug-0078)
                - stop process during right after attach
                  doesn't work right away (only with delay)
  This is fixed now.
--------------------------------------------------------

* (jeg) Record command broken
   Jim investigated and this appears to be working in his
   version.
--------------------------------------------------------

- IA-64 memory corruption bug (also on other systems?)
  -> contact Dong Ahn for help with TV on thunder
--------------------------------------------------------

* File not found box shows not the filename it tries to open
  (shown filename exists, but still can't open file)

* (dpm) The shown filename is not the file that was actually requested
   but rather the last known opened file. The error was for the
   current file being opened (which did not exist) and therefore
   the sourcepanel should not do anything more than display
   the "file does not exist" string in it's label field.
   This should now be fixed.
--------------------------------------------------------

* When selecting system source files, we open any file, but
  give no error

* (dpm) This appears related to the other SourcePanel focus
   issues where a source file does not exist (e.g. libc source files).
   In this case we just display "file does not exist" in the
   label field of the source panel in question.

--------------------------------------------------------
* (jeg) fixed 12/27/06 After focus stats panel we should open stats panel, not
  as currently the source panel
--------------------------------------------------------

* (jeg) added 12/27/06 Can't have multiple equal MPIs
  (at least need documentation about what changes)
  jeg - added README-mpi to top level source directory to explain mpi configurations
--------------------------------------------------------

- FPE: x86-64 get only one SI code
  (fix display to clean it up at least)
  Nathan and Don are looking into how to report this to kernel
  developers
--------------------------------------------------------

- GUI problem with PAPI selection?
--------------------------------------------------------

- Can't attach a second collector to an experiment created
  by a wizard
  (jeg) additional info.  It can be done but one must be over a process
        in the manage process panel.  The GUI is picking up text and trying
        to match that text with processes and hosts.  When you hover and right
        mouse button down over a blank area the GUI doesn't know what the processes
        and hosts you want to associate with the new collector and doesn't add it.
--------------------------------------------------------

* (jeg) added 12/27/08 Want the manageprocess panel brought up with the
  custom experiment
--------------------------------------------------------

* (jeg) added 01/02/07 Need error message/warning when experiment doesn't create
  data (right now it's just a blank screen)
--------------------------------------------------------

- Looks like the path remapping only applies to the first experiment.  I had multiple
  experiments up and did the path remapping from the 2nd experiments menu but only the
  first experiments path was changed.   jeg  1/5/2007
--------------------------------------------------------

* (jeg) fixed 1/8/2007 The "no data samples" message was not being hidden, so if
        there was data to be displayed for the current instantiation of the experiment
        view, it would not be viewable.  Added re-initialization when the data was updated.
