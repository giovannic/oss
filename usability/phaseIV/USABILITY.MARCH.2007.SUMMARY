                 Phase IV Usability Study   3/20/07
         Conducted by Jim Galarowicz, Martin Schulz, and Dave Montoya
         At: LANL


General Summary:

   - Make these easy:
     - Change focus to a rank or set of ranks
     - Able to see which ranks,processes, or threads the stats panel statistics represent
     - Do some of custom panel functionality automatically
     - Save stats panel view while bringing up another (called recycle)
     - Have a hierarchy, function, statements and make the scoping clear
       - If by function - list all functions
   - Parallel job load dialog was not clear enough
     - Suggested have separate multiprocess load and scalar load dialogs
   - Tooltips context boxes are sometimes too big and block the items that are trying to be viewed
   - Right click on Tab is not recognized.
     - Critical functionality shouldn't be hidden in the Tab, maybe a drop down menu is alternative
   - Bring up the process management panel when loading an experiment.
   - Don't mix checkbox and radio buttons in the IntroWizard


Bugs/Issues Found

1) Manage Process Panel (both sides) didn't appear to be updating
   after RUN was pushed.  Could be a preference setting.  There
   is a preference for how often to update the panel.

2) No error checking in the pc sample rate entry box.

3) Can't execute this executable message needs a scroll bar.

4) Load parallel dialog box incorrectly goes to the next wizard page on a cancel.

5) Tooltip delay time didn't seem long enough.  The tooltips kept popping up annoyingly.

6) Container word is too technical for the users.  Maybe use panel?

7) Messages about executing "expview -x 2 -v xxxxx" coming out in popups
   are too technical.   Make a preference for these.  Use non-technical English
   to explain what is going on if the preference is not set.

8) No cancel on usertime delete experiment message.  No way to back out of it.

9) Add/delete/describe message dialog cancel should be close.

10) Core dump at SS_Cmd_Execution.cxx at line 445.

11) Tooltip in ManageProcessesPanel is too big and comes up to fast.

12) Two check boxes and six radio buttons on the IntroWizard panel is confusing.
    Make all radio buttons.   Currently looks like you have to choose one check
    box and then one of the radio buttons.

13) Maybe load the executable/application prior to giving the user experiment type
    questions.

14) Have more consistent buttons across the wizards.
    a) First screen should have grayed out "Finish" button
    b) Use "Back" name instead of "<<Intro" on the second pages of the wizards
    c) "Clear" should be "Reset" to be consistent with what it is really doing.

15) Reorganize the menus and panels to have a better hierarchy of tasks.  Users
    are currently unaware of what the data scoping is.

16) Add a scoping widget to the stats panel and maybe to all the panels to
    hold the critical information.  In the stats panel this would be:
      a) Execution Environment: What hosts, processes, ranks, or threads involved
      b) What processes/ranks/threads does the current view of the performance data represent
      c) Tools to compare ranks, show individual ranks etc should be available here.
