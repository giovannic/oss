openss(1)                                                openss(1)


NAME
  openss - Collects Open|SpeedShop performance data

SYNOPSIS
  openss -cli [-h host] [-f "executable arg1 arg2 arg3 ..."] [-p process_ID [-t thread_ID] ] [experiment_name]


DESCRIPTION
  Open|SpeedShop(tm) is a performance tool designed to capture performance data
  for an executable(s).

  When collecting the performance data, openss either writes the data to 
  a file and makes it available to be displayed by the command line interface
  or the graphical user interface.
 
  You can specify the following options on the command line:
    -h host
      Specifies the host on which an executable should be run, 
      or where a process to be attached is located.

    -f executable
      Specifies the executable to run the performance experiment on.
      Specifies that openss is going to create a new process

    -p process_ID
      Specifies the running process to attach to for performance gathering.
      Specifies that openss is going to attach to the identified process.

    -t thread_ID
      Specifies specifying a single thread to be attached within the given
      PID (rather than ALL threads by default)..

    -cli   Run only the command line interface part of openss.
           (Note: The Graphical User Interface (GUI) can be
           brought up later with the opengui command.

    experiment_name
      Specifies the experiment to be run on the executable or process.

      o pcsamp   - Actual CPU time at the source line, machine instruction,
		   and function levels by sampling the program counter at
		   intervals. PC sampling samples at 10mS (down to 1mS)
		   intervals. One could sample at the slower rate, but the
		   data would be approaching useless. The default is 10mS.
  
      o usertime - Inclusive and exclusive CPU time for each function by
		   sampling the callstack at intervals.Usertime samples at
		   30mS intervals by default. But could sample at 10mS
		   intervals.

      o fpe      - All floating-point exceptions, with the exception type
                   and the call stack at the time of the exception. See 
                   FPE Tracing Wizard. (Currently unimplemented.)

      o hwc      - Counts at the source line, machine instruction, and
                   function levels of various hardware events, including:
                   clock cycles, graduated instructions, primary
                   instruction cache misses, secondary instruction cache
                   misses, primary data cache misses, secondary data
                   cache misses, translation lookaside buffer (TLB)
                   misses, and graduated floating-point instructions.
                   See HW Counter Wizard. (Currently unimplemented.)

      o io       - Traces the following I/O system calls: read, readv,
                   write, writev, open, close, dup, pipe, creat. 
                   See IO Wizard. (Currently unimplemented.)

      o mpi      - Traces calls to various MPI routines.
                   See MPI Wizard. (Currently unimplemented.)


EXAMPLES:
  To start Open|Speedshop simply type:
  $ openss


  To load an executable to run a simple timing (pcSampling) experiment:
  $ openss -f a.out pcsamp


  To attach to a running executable:
  $ openss -p 123456


  To load an executable that takes a command line argument:
  $ openss -f "a.out abc"  pcsamp

 
  To run Open|Speed shop without the GUI use the -cli option:
  $ openss -cli
  openss>>
