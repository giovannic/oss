                         Usability Study


Introduction:
-------------

For this assignment you'll be asked to analyze performance
output from 2 previously executed performance experiments.

There is no time constraint to "correctly" complete this task.

Please try to "think aloud" as you work through the scenario.   
It will help us understand where our problems are.

Remember:  You are not being tested.    The user interface and it's
ease of use, is being analyzed.   Your initial feedback and thoughts as you 
navigate through this set of tasks will enable us to see our problem
areas.


Open|SpeedShop is a tool designed by SGI in cooperation with several national
labs.   The executable is, "openss".   There is a man page, "man openss".

Enjoy.




The Scenario:
-------------

There are 2 directories, sweep3d_A and sweep3d_B that contain 2 versions of 
the application sweep3d.   Experiment data has already been collected on both
these applications.   X1.sweep3d_A.usertime.openss corresponds to the
application built in the sweep3d_A directory and is considered the baseline
version.  

There was an algorithm change made to sweep3d in the sweep3d_B directory and
performance data has been collected in the data file
X1.sweep3d_B.usertime.openss.   

In general we'll be asking you to compare the 2 experiment files to see if 
you can determine where the performance problem occurs.   Then we'll be
looking to have you generate a detail report comparing the offending
processs against the other processes in the run.




The Assignment:
---------------

Step 1:
  From the 2 data files in the current directory, determine which execution
took the least time to run.  i.e. Which one ran the fastest, using the least
amount of cpu time.  (In this test case, the one using the least amount
of cpu time also took the shortest amount of wall-clock time.)

Step 2:
  Determine which routine is the most likely to have caused the performance
degradation.

Step 3:
  Determine which statement/statements are the culprits of the slow down.

Step 4:
  Determine which process is most relevant to the slow down.

Step 5:
  In the StatsPanel, show the exclusive time for the process that took
the most time in one column, comparing it to one (or all) of the other
processes in another column.

Step n:
  Exit the Open|Speedshop tool.
