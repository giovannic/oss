                 Phase II Usability Study   4/27/05
         Conducted by Chip Kent, Scott Cranford, Martin Shulz, and Al Stipek


          As last time, there's definitely room for improvement...


Good candidates again.  I'd like to thank Chip for organizing this 
study and all the candidates for their time and input.

Four candidates were chosen for the study conducted on 04/27/05.


The users were able to complete the assignments, for the most
part, in fairly short order.   There are areas for improvement
and 2 of those are most obvious to me.   First, when loading an 
experiment from the command line ($openss -f fred pcsamp) there needs
be both more feed back that the experiment is being loaded and the
experiment panel needs to be created and raised.  (This was by far 
the most glaring problem encountered.)   The other was the candidates
often struggled with locating the menus.  The little triangle was not
understood to be a way to raise a local menu.

There are other areas for improvement as well.   The dialogs to 
attach "collectors" and "Attach" processes were not intuitive enough.
This was true of most all the dialogs.

Also worth noting in the summary, the term "Collector" means nothing
to the user.   While we've become educated to this term, when 
presenting it to the user, they drew a blank.  (The did however
seem comfortable with the 'experiment' concept.)

Much other feedback and room for improvement were also discovered.
I've attempted to itemize them as action items below.  

Please feel free to correct/add/delete anything you interpreted differently.


1 - When loading the execuable and experiment from the command line,
    we need to bring up the experiment directly.    This was a major
    source of confusion for 3 of the 4 candidates.  I'm sure it would
    have been confusing for 4 of 4 had the other candidate not come
    into Open|SpeedShop and used the wizard to load the experiment.

    o One suggestion was to bring up the 'Summary wizard' page, 
      with a progress bar, then bring up the experiment panel.

    o Another suggestion is to bring up the experiment panel 
      after the experiment has been finished being instrumented.
      (Maybe with a dialog showing progress is being made and 
      a status line being displayed.)
FIXED: current:OpenSpeedShop:191911a

2 - When setting command line options (openss -f fred pcsamp)
    the GUI should take hints from any failure that may of prevented
    the command from being completed.   While I'd rate this at a 
    lower priority this could help people from further frustration.
PENDING: Partially implemented.

3 - It's not clear that the user output is going to the shell 
    window where the openss command was issued.   People expected
    it to go to the CmdPanel when the gui is visible.  

4 - There should only be one cli.  All candidates and observers
    agreed it should be the CmdPanel when in GUI mode.
FIXED: current:OpenSpeedShop:191911a

5 - Cumulative percent should be removed from the pcsamp default
    report.   (As per a suggestion... I'll wait for feedback if 
    others agree with this comment.)
FIXED:

6 - "File->Save Experiment ..." needs better descriptive wording.
    Also, since it's an overview window (the start of one anyway)
    maybe it should be turned into a panel and the
    "File->Save Experiment" functionaly should be hung off it.

7 - When attaching a "collector" or process to an experiment, put the
    current status somewhere.   Possibilities may be a dialog box,
    or even in the experiment window itself.

8 - A feature addition:  The user wants to be able to sort the
    pcStatsPanel like we currently do.  However they also want to
    select a set of items (from the list) and only show them.

9 - Change "Construct New Experiment" to "Custom Experiment"
FIXED

10- Allow the flexibility to change the tab name. (Experiment name)
    Allow this from a menu option on the tab, or at the wizard
    interface.

    Martin adds:
      Should this change the name in all associated windows (if the
      main experiment name becomes part of the tab names)? Also,
      should this be part of the CLI as well, since ID won't make
      sense to the user anymore once they exit the GUI? 
PARTIAL FIX:  Supported in GUI not in cli

11- Put the "Experiments" menu under the File->Experiments entry.
FIXED:

12- When bringing up a "fresh" experiment, put a "dialog" inito
    the blank panel container that will help the user Load a 
    process/program/"collector".
PARTIAL FIX: We now put a wizard in all 'blank' experiments, except
the Custom Experiment Panel.   That panel is one-off and may need
a separate wizard panel...

13- When loading an "collector" into an experiment, the dialog 
    reads, "Loading Executable"... it should be "Loading Experiment"
FIXED:

14- Add a "Window'-like entry to list the experiments that are
    currently available to be raised in the gui.
    NOTE: The overview panel may be another approach.

15- The "Open Saved Experiment" as well as the "Open Existing 
    Experiment" should create and raise the experiment directly
    rather than requiring the use to take one more step to
    select the entry to be raised.
FIXED:

16- Pet-peeve:  Single click should highlight in the pcStatsPanel,
    double click should raise the source.  (Of course single
    vs double click should be used consistently across the tool.)
FIXED:

17- The user should be able to do a rerun.
    The users commented that they will run with one set of input
    paramaters, then they'll run with a different set of parameters.
    They don't want to script this, they simply want to change the
    arguments to their executable and run again.

18- BUG: opess -f "fred 1000" usertime    ABORTS.
FIXED: 

19- Allow selecting multiple entries off the Intro Wizard.

20- Possibly put a 'Close' on the local panel menu.

21- Need a source navigator.

22- BUG: Save data to file when showing 2 experiments, and the 
    first entry was never run.   Selects first experiment.... ABORT.
FIXED:

23- Try adding a icon bar, next to the 'x' that doesn menu, split
    horizontal, split vertical, and 'x'.
    Change the icon menu to something more obvious... maybe MS-Ladder...
FIXED:

24- Should we use the term 'Tab' instead of 'Panel'?

25- BUG: Selecting Save Experiment but not selecting item causes ABORT.
FIXED:

26- The sort indicator in pcStatsPanel seems reversed.
REJECTED:   I checked with a designer example and the sort indicator is
            as trolltech wants it...

27- BUG: Update brings up pcStatsPanel.
FIXED:

28- Add tooltip regarding menus (i.e. "Right mouse button for
    context sensitive menu.")
FIXED:

29- No intuitive way to delete a panel container.   Possibly leave
    the icon bar on an empty panel container.
FIXED:

30- BUG:  Panel layout resize problem.   Resize, split, then tried removing
    the CmdPanel (or the PanelContainer the CmdPanel was in).   Did not
    resize/reposition correctly.   (Actually in retrospect this may have
    worked.  If I remember correctly, the user may have shrunk the thumb
    into a small area and this was being resized.... Hmmm.)
PENDING: (Unable to reproduce.)

31- "Managing Collectors and Process" still needs more help understanding
    what it does.   Suggests changing this to simply "Manager Processes..."
FIXED:

32- "Collector" is an internal name.   Use one that is more generic
    and meaningful.   One suggestion was "Instrumentation."

33- Possibly add an 'unsplit' menu option.

34- "Attach Program" should be "Load Program" (Manage Collectors and Processes)
Fixed:
                                                                                
35- "Detach Collector" should be "Remove Collector" -- Remember "Collector"
    should be something different...

36- Color for tabs experiment number.   This is easier to show association
    rather than [1] number.   NOTE: The v menu option could be used to
    easily show color association.
FIXED:
                                                                                
37- In the Intro Wizard add the actual experiment name after the
    more wordy description.
    i.e. "I'm trying to find where my program is spending most of it's time"
    should be:
    I'm trying to find where my program is spending most of it's time. [pcsamp]
FIXED:
                                                                                
38- Make more consistent usage of the experiment terms.  i.e. use
    pcsamp, pc Sampling, pc Sample Experiment but don't mix them all.

39- Finish - Load - Finish in the wizard, skip the last Finish.
FIXED
                                                                                
40- "Finish" to "Use Defaults"... (After thinking about this
    one, "Use Defaults" would be confusing as it may be misleading
    that each page would want that entry.   I see Martin's
    issue, but would ask for a different wording suggestion.

    Martin adds:
      I see the problem with "Use defaults"; that would be confusing.
      What about keeping "Finish Wizard" and using this button to
      accept all defaults that were not selected, yet, and then skip
      forward to the experiment panel without asking for a binary
      or confirmation. Using the "Finish Wizard" button right after
      selecting an experiment would then be the same as just selecting
      the experiment without a wizard.
FIXED:
                                                                                
41- Intro Wizard Scrollbar.   Move the scrollbar to the inner
    frame so the buttons can be seen without scrolling the window.

42- Bug: Source Panel, when it can't find source don't reposition
    the 'current' source.
FIXED: mod current:OpenSpeedShop:192690a 

43- Run button status.   When launching executable, change the
    status first to "launching", "Paused - Ready to run", then
    to Running.   Greying the buttons as appropriate.

44- Put a clock out on the run button (or some visible status area)
    that ticks the wall clock time the executable is taking...

45- Grey "Update Button" when loading from Saved File.

46- Grey "Other buttons" when loading from Saved File.

47- Make the Overview "Open Existing Experiment" a panel.

48- (Make the "Manager Collectors and Processes" a panel.)

49- Add a 'gather routine" for all associated panels.  This
    would basically pull all disjoint panels (with same
    expid) to one experiment panel and locate the
    experiment int the top-level (focused) window/frame.

50- Also add a function to delete all the panels associated
    with an experiment.   Possibly add this to the 'close
    experiment dialog"
       Delete (expClose) the experiment?
       Selecting Yes will delete the experiment.
       Selecting No will close the window.
       [x] Close all related windows.
       [Yes]   [No]

51- When you restarted the GUI from the CLI,
    the GUI came as you left it - it might be easier for the user,
    if you could open/raise the experiment panel of the currently
    focused experiment. That's presumably the experiment the user
    has worked on last and hence wants to see now. Even better
    would be an optional argument to opengui that users can use to
    specify an experiment (orthogonal to all other commands), but
    that's not a comment for you alone anymore. 

52- Move Wizards to the File-> menu.
FIXED:


Other comments and requests:

  - HPC Toolkit
    I was asked to look at thie for tree display example. (Chip)

  - gprof callstacks 
    I was asked to look at this for callgraph example.  (Scott)

  - Multiprocess management
    In this case, the user was saying that he wanted a single tool
    that allows him to do both serial and parallel performance analysis.  
    He would like it to be able to do both gprof/prof type experiments 
    plus vampir type MPI tracing.  He was saying that he was forced 
    to use pixie and totalview in the past, but it doesn't work as 
    well as a single tool would.
                                                                                
  - Wants one data file, not many.   Wants to be able to compare
    one run to another.

  - Better/Hierarchical source navigation (make all modules belonging
    to one application visible)
