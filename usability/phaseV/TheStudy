                        The Study.

Approximately 60 minutes should be allow for each test.

The observers should be limited to 1-3 for each session.

It is expected that each candidate will take 15-30 minutes to complete the 
test.   Each test will conclude (regardless of completion) at the end of
the 30 minute time period.

Observers must not give hints or suggestions to the candidate unless the 
candidate asks for help and then only enough information to allow the process
to proceed should be given.

There should be a keeper of notes.


Here's how each session goes:

  o An assignment sheet, paper, and pen is all that is provided for the user.

  o The candidate is welcomed into the room and give a very short introduction 
    as to what is being done.   Basically they are sat down at the workstation,
    given a short description (that is also reiterated on the assignment sheet),
    then asked to think aloud as they go along.   Then they are allowed to
    complete the assignment.  They are give 30 minutes to complete the task, but
    it's best if they are not aware of the time limit.


  o At the end of the session a 5-15 minute wrap up session should be held with 
    the candidate.   The candidate should be ask questions such as the
    following:

    - What is your overall opinion of the tool?  i.e. Was it easy enough
      to invoke?    Did it give useful feedback?   Were you able to obtain
      the answer(s) you were looking for?

    - What was confusing?

    - Were there any wording issues that could be clearer?  If so, what might
      you suggest?
   
    - Do you have any suggestions to improve the overall usability of the tool?

    - Do you have any suggestions to improve the overall appearance of the tool?

    - Any other suggestions?

    Obviously if the user struggled in certain areas, questions targeting the
    reason for the confusion should be asked.


  o Following the candidate's interview process there should be a 10-15 minutes
    wrap-up session with the observers to go over the notes and to discuss any
    possible recommendations.


At the end of the sessions, a report detailing any problems and suggested 
recommendations should be written.
