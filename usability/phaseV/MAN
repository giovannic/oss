openss(1)                                                openss(1)


NAME
  openss - Collects Open|SpeedShop performance data

SYNOPSIS
  openss [-cli] [-gui] [-batch]  [-h host] [-f "executable arg1 arg2 arg3 ..."]
         [-p process_ID [-t thread_ID] ] [experiment_name]


DESCRIPTION
  Open|SpeedShop(tm) is a performance tool designed to capture various types of 
  performance data for an executable or set of executables.

  When collecting the performance data, openss writes the gathered performance data to 
  a file and makes it available to be displayed by the command line interface
  or the graphical user interface.  The performance data can be displayed at the end
  of the application execution or the intermediate results can be displayed during the
  application's execution.
 
  You can specify the following options on the command line:

    -h host
      Specifies the host on which an executable should be run, 
      or where a process to be attached is located.

    -f executable or "executable args"
      Specifies the executable to run the performance experiment on.
      Specifies that openss is going to create a new process

    -p process_ID
      Specifies the running process to attach to for performance gathering.
      Specifies that openss is going to attach to the identified process.

    -t thread_ID
      Specifies specifying a single thread to be attached within the given
      PID (rather than ALL threads by default)..

    -cli    
      Run only the command line interface part of openss.
      (Note: The Graphical User Interface (GUI) can be
      brought up later with the opengui command.

    -gui   
      (default)  Run only the the graphical user interface (GUI).

    -batch  
      Run a set of OpenSpeedShop commands from a file or file directed into 
      the openss command.

    experiment_name

      Specifies the experiment to be run on the executable or process.

      o pcsamp   - CPU time at the source line, machine instruction,
		   and function levels by sampling the program counter at
		   intervals. PC sampling samples at 10mS (down to 1mS)
		   intervals. 
  
      o usertime - Inclusive and exclusive CPU time for each function by
		   sampling the callstack at intervals.  Usertime samples at
		   30mS intervals by default. But could sample at 10mS
		   intervals.

      o fpe      - All floating-point exceptions, with the exception type
                   and the call stack at the time of the exception. See 
                   FPE Tracing Wizard. 

      o hwc      - Counts at the source line, machine instruction, and
                   function levels of various hardware events, including:
                   clock cycles, graduated instructions, primary
                   instruction cache misses, secondary instruction cache
                   misses, primary data cache misses, secondary data
                   cache misses, translation lookaside buffer (TLB)
                   misses, and graduated floating-point instructions.
                   See HW Counter Wizard. 

      o io       - Traces the following I/O system calls: read, readv,
                   write, writev, open, close, dup, pipe, creat. 
                   See IO Wizard. 

      o mpi      - Traces calls to selected MPI routines.
                   See MPI Wizard. 

      o mpit     - Traces calls to selected MPI routines with additional
                   information, such as, source and destination ranks, bytes
                   of data transferred, etc..
                   See MPI Wizard. 


EXAMPLES:
  To start Open|SpeedShop and use the wizard capability to guide the creation of
  an Open|SpeedShop experiment simply type:
  $ openss


  To load an executable into the GUI and set up to run a program counter sampling (pcsamp) 
  experiment:
  $ openss -f a.out pcsamp


  To attach to a running executable:
  $ openss -p 123456


  To load an executable that takes a command line argument:
  $ openss -f "a.out abc"  pcsamp

 
  To run Open|SpeedShop in interactive command line mode use the -cli option:
  $ openss -cli
  openss>>
 
  To run Open|SpeedShop in batch mode mode use the -batch option:
  $ openss -batch < file_of_commands
