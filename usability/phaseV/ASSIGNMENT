                         Usability Study


Introduction:
-------------

For this assignment you'll be asked to create performance
analysis output by creating and running an Open|SpeedShop 
performance experiment on an mpi application.

There is no time constraint to "correctly" complete this task.

Please try to "think out loud" as you work through the scenario.   
It will help us understand where our problems are.

Remember:  You are not being tested.  The user interface and it's
ease of use, is really what is being analyzed.   Your initial feedback 
and thoughts as you navigate through this set of tasks will enable 
us to see our ease of use problem areas.

Open|SpeedShop is a performance tool being developed by the 
Krell Institute in cooperation and partnership with the Tri-Labs labs.

The executable is, "openss".   
There is a man page, "openss-MAN".

Thanks!
We appreciate the time you have taken today to help us!




The Scenario:
-------------

We will "give" (on zeus) you a tarball file derived from a directory containing  
containing a version of a program named sweep3d.  The sweep3d source was modified 
to contain an algorithm change that degrades performance for one of the ranked 
processes.   Please untar the tarball file in a directory somewhere under your 
home directory and use the contents of this directory for this usability study.

In general we're asking you to run OpenSpeedShop on this version of sweep3d using
the OpenSpeedShop graphical user interface (GUI) and to try to determine where
the performance problem is occurring.  

Typically, and in this case sweep3d.mpi is launched using the srun command
in a form such as this: srun -N 4 -n 8 sweep3d.mpi.


The Assignment:

-----------------------------------------------
PHASE 1: Run and Analyze Live Data
-----------------------------------------------
Step 0:

From the sweep3d subdirectory, run the sweep3d.mpi application
outside of OpenSpeedShop using this command: srun -N 4 -n 8 sweep3d.mpi.  
This verifies that sweep3d.mpi runs outside of OpenSpeedShop.


Step 1:


From the same subdirectory, launch the OpenSpeedShop GUI.

NOTE 1: Please do:  "use openss"
        This sets up the environment for you to access the OpenSpeedShop tool.

NOTE 2: If needed, please refer to the file "openss-MAN" for hints on 
        how to launch OpenSpeedShop.  


Step 2:

Use the OpenSpeedShop wizard to launch the sweep3d.mpi executable 
to determine what part of the sweep3d program is taking the most time.


NOTE 1: Use the same basic mpi command syntax you used above to launch 
        sweep3d.mpi outside of OpenSpeedShop.


Step 3:

When the experiment completes the Stats Panel will pop up.

After that happens, can you determine which routine is the 
taking the most time.  

Is it in the sweep3d application?  

Can you determine what hosts and ranks are represented 
in the Stats Panel performance data display?


Step 4:

Save the performance data results from this experiment to a
file for analysis for another time in the future.


Step 5:

Display the results by statement (source line) 


Step 6:

Go to statement in the source file that is taking the most time.

You may need to remap the source location from the directory it
was created to the directory you are running from.


Step 7:

Find out if any of the ranked processes are taking more time 
than the others.


Step 8:

Redisplay the results for the whole application displaying the
results by function.


Step 9:

Show the performance results for the rank 0 process only. 

Can you preserve the current Stats Panel results window 
before doing the above rank 0 display?


Step 10:

Compare the performance data from rank 0 to the performance data 
from rank 1.


Step 11:

Exit the OpenSpeedShop tool.




THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION!
