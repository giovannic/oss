# mknewpanel

# Creates a basic skeletal Open|SpeedShop GUI panel that can be modified to integrate with 
# the Open|SpeedShop tools.  The skeletal panel code created by executing mknewpanel will
# contain the include header references and basic Qt functionality to compile and integrate
# with the rest of Open|SpeedShop.  Some minor configuration file and make file changes 
# are needed for the integration into Open|SpeedShop.  The mknewpanel script informs the
# script user which files to modify.

# usage: mknewpanel directory panelname "menu header" "menu label" "menu accel" "show immediate" "grouping"
# where:
#  directory:  Is the path to the directory to put the new panel code.
#  panelname:  Is the name of the new panel.
#  menu header: Is the Menu named to be put on the menu bar.
#  menu label: Is the menu label under the menu header.
#  menu accel: Is the menu accelerator.
#  show immediate: Default is 0.  Setting this to 1 will display the panel upon initialization.
#  grouping: Which named panel container should this menu item drop this panel by default.

# Example:
# mknewpanel ../FPE_TracingPanel "FPE_TracingPanel" "E\&xperiments" "\&FPE_Tracing" "Ctrl+F" 0 "Performance"
mknewpanel ../ExamplePanel "ExamplePanel" "E\&xperiments" "ExamplePanel" " " 0 "Performance"
