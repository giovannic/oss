/*! \mainpage "Open|SpeedShop Message Unit Library"

    \section intro Introduction
    
    The message unit is an attempt to concentrate message
    handling into one place. The idea is to allow developer
    flexibilty while at the same time making it easier to 
    make greater changes in the future such as localization.
    
    There will be one OpenSpeedShop::SS_Message_Czar object 
    per SpeedShop run.
    Currently the message library just grows. All information
    for a given message key is subitted once. We may want to
    loosen this in the future if there is any need.
    
    Error messages can have numeric tags associated with them
    so one can look up a message by this tag.

    \section howto
    
    Grab an instance of OpenSpeedShop::SS_Message_Czar with a call 
    to theMessageCzar().
    It will be automatically initialized if this is the first call.
    
    Start loading the message unit with message data.

    An example of adding messages from a message table of type
    OpenSpeedShop::message_element_t:

    \ref example1.cxx

    Another example demonstrating loading message information
    one element at time:

    \ref example3.cxx

    For messages for plugins I suggest strongly that you make
    a message table and have it read in during plugin startup.

    \section Conventions
   
    	Class names: UpperUpper (eg. SS_Message_Czar)

	Private data members: dm_lower_lower (eg. dm_error_list)

	Public data members: lower_lower (eg. data_member)

	All function members: lowerUpper (eg. add_Help)

    Put public declarations before private to expose
    the user with what they can use up front.
