    <h2> Brief Open|SpeedShop Overview </h2>
    Open|SpeedShop is a community effort by <a
      href="http://www.krellinst.org/"
onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.krellinst.org']);"
      target="_blank">The Krell Institute</a> with current direct
    funding from DOE&#8217;s NNSA and Office of Science. It is building on top
    of a broad list of community infrastructures, most notably Dyninst
    and MRNet from the Universities of Wisconsin and Maryland,
    libmonitor from Rice University, and PAPI from the University of
    Tennessee at Knoxville. Open|SpeedShop is an open source multi
    platform Linux performance tool which is initially targeted to
    support performance analysis of applications running on both single
    node and large scale IA64, IA32, EM64T, AMD64, and IBM Power PC
    platforms. Support for the Cray XT platform was added in release
    1.9.3.4 and support for the IBM Blue Gene platforms was added in the
    2.0.0 release. Further updates to the Blue Gene and Cray platforms
    were delivered in the 2.0.1 release.&nbsp;&nbsp; Support for
    shared/dynamic executables on the Cray-XE platforms are included in
    the 2.0.1 release. <br>
    <p>Open|SpeedShop is explicitly designed with usability in mind and
      is for application developers and computer scientists. The base
      functionality include:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Sampling Experiments</li>
      <li>Support for Callstack Analysis</li>
      <li>Hardware Performance Counters</li>
      <li>MPI Profiling and Tracing</li>
      <li>I/O Profiling and Tracing</li>
      <li>Floating Point Exception Analysis</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition, Open|SpeedShop is designed to be modular and
      extensible. It supports several levels of plug-ins which allow
      users to add their own performance experiments.</p>
    <p>Open|SpeedShop development is hosted by the Krell Institute. The
      infrastructure and base components of Open|SpeedShop are released
      as open source code primarily under LGPL.</p>

    <h2> About Getting Started </h2>
    The primary focus of this document will be on introducing many of
    Open|SpeedShop's key features. In particular we will be covering: <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Common Terminology</li>
      <li>Available Experiments</li>
      <li>Open|SpeedShop Invocation</li>
      <li>Using Open|SpeedShop's Interactive Command Line Interface
        (CLI)</li>
      <li>Using Open|SpeedShop's Graphical User Interface (GUI)</li>
      <li>Getting More Information</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Common Terminology</h2>
    Technical terms can have multiple and/or context sensitive meanings,
    therefore this section attempts to explain and clarify the meanings
    of the terms used in this document.
    <ul>
      <li><b>Experiment:</b> A set of collectors and executables bound
        together to generate performance metrics.</li>
      <li><b>Focused Experiment:</b> The current experiment commands
        operate on. The user may run or view multiple experiments
        simultaneously and unless a particular experiment is specified
        directly, the focused experiment will used. Experiments are
        given an enumeration (expId) for identification.</li>
      <li><b>Component(s):</b> A somewhat self-contained section of the
        Open|SpeedShop performance tool. This section of code does a set
        of specific related tasks for the tool. For example, the GUI
        component does all the tasks related to displaying
        Open|SpeedShop wizards, experiment creation, and results using a
        graphical user interface. The CLI component does similar
        functions but uses the interactive command line delivery method.</li>
      <li><b>Collector:</b> The portion of the tool containing logic
        that is responsible for the gathering of the performance metric.
        A collector is a portion of the code that is included in the
        experiment plugin.</li>
      <li><b>Metric:</b> The entity, which the collector/experiment is
        gathering. A time, occurrence counter, or other entity, which
        reflects in some way on the applications performance and is
        gathered by a performance experiment (by the collector).</li>
      <li><b>Param:</b> Each collector allows the user to set certain
        values that control the way a collector behaves. The parameter
        or param may cause the collector to perform various operations
        at certain time intervals or it may cause a collector to measure
        certain types of data. Although Open|SpeedShop provides a
        standard way to set a parameter, it is up to the individual
        collector to decide what to do with that information. Detailed
        documentation about the available parameters is part of the
        collector's documentation.</li>
      <li><b>Framework:</b> The set of API functions that allows the
        user interface to manage the creation and viewing of performance
        experiments. It is the interface between the user interface and
        the cluster support and dynamic instrumentation components.</li>
      <li><b>Plugin:</b> A portion of the performance tool that can be
        loaded and included in the tool at tool start-up time.
        Development of the plugin uses a tool specific interface (API)
        so that the plugin, and the tool it is to be included in, know
        how to interact with each other. Plugins are normally placed in
        a specific directory so that the tool knows where to find the
        plugins.</li>
      <li><b>Target:</b> This is the application or part of the
        application one is running the experiment on. In order to fine
        tune what is being targeted, Open|SpeedShop gives target options
        that describes file names, host names, thread identifiers, rank
        identifiers and process identifiers.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
