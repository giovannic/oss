<h2> Open|SpeedShop Overview </h2>
<br>
<p><strong>Overview</strong><br>
Open|SpeedShop is a community effort by <a
 href="http://www.krellinst.org/" target="_blank">The Krell Institute</a>
with current direct funding from DOE&#8217;s NNSA and Office of Science. It
is building on top of a broad list of community infrastructures, most
notably Dyninst and MRNet from UW, libmonitor from Rice, and PAPI from
UTK. Open|SpeedShop is an open source multi platform Linux performance
tool which is initially targeted to support performance analysis of
applications running on both single node and large scale IA64, IA32,
EM64T, AMD64, and IBM Power PC platforms. Recently support for the Cray
XT platform was added in release 1.9.3.4 and support for the IBM Blue
Gene platforms will be added in the next release (2.0.0 in November
2010).</p>
<p>Open|SpeedShop is explicitly designed with usability in mind and is
for application developers and computer scientists. The base
functionality include:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Sampling Experiments</li>
  <li>Support for Callstack Analysis</li>
  <li>Hardware Performance Counters</li>
  <li>MPI Profiling and Tracing</li>
  <li>I/O Profiling and Tracing</li>
  <li>Floating Point Exception Analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, Open|SpeedShop is designed to be modular and
extensible. It supports several levels of plug-ins which allow users to
add their own performance experiments.</p>
<p>Open|SpeedShop development is hosted by the Krell Institute. The
infrastructure and base components of Open|SpeedShop are released as
open source code primarily under LGPL.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong><strong></strong></p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Comprehensive performance analysis for sequential, multithreaded,
and MPI applications</li>
  <li>No need to recompile the user&#8217;s application.</li>
  <li>Supports both first analysis steps as well as deeper analysis
options for performance experts</li>
  <li>Easy to use GUI and fully scriptable through a command line
interface and Python</li>
  <li>Supports Linux Systems and Clusters with Intel and AMD processors</li>
  <li>Extensible through new performance analysis plugins ensuring
consistent look and feel</li>
  <li>In production use on all major cluster platforms at LANL, LLNL,
and SNL</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Features</strong><strong></strong></p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Four user interface options: batch, command line interface,
graphical user interface and Python scripting API.</li>
  <li>Supports multi-platform single system image(SSI) and traditional
clusters.</li>
  <li>Scales to large numbers of processes, threads, and ranks.</li>
  <li>Ability to automatically create and attach to both sequential and
parallel jobs from within Open|SpeedShop.</li>
  <li>View performance data using multiple customizable views.</li>
  <li>View intermediate performance measurement data while the
experiment is running.</li>
  <li>Save and restore performance experiment data and symbol
information for post experiment performance analysis</li>
  <li>View performance data for all of application&#8217;s lifetime or
smaller time slices.</li>
  <li>Compare performance results between processes, threads, or ranks
between a previous experiment and current experiment.</li>
  <li>GUI Wizard facility and context sensitive help.</li>
  <li>Interactive CLI help facility which lists the CLI commands,
syntax, and typical usage.</li>
  <li>Python Scripting API accesses Open|SpeedShop functionality
corresponding to CLI commands.</li>
  <li>Option to automatically group like performing processes, threads,
or ranks.</li>
  <li>Create traces in OTF (Open Trace Format).</li>
  <li>Comprehensive installation scripts.</li>
</ul>
