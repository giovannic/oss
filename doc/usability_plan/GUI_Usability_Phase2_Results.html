</h2>
<br>
Good candidates again. I'd like to thank Chip for organizing this study
and all the candidates for their time and input.
<pre><br></pre>
Four candidates were chosen for the study conducted on 04/27/05.<br>
<br>
<br>
The users were able to complete the assignments, for the most part, in
fairly short order. There are areas for improvement<br>
and 2 of those are most obvious to me. First, when loading an
experiment from the command line ($openss -f fred pcsamp) there needs
be both more feed back that the experiment is being loaded and the
experiment panel needs to be created and raised. (This was by far the
most glaring problem encountered.) The other was the candidates often
struggled with locating the menus. The little triangle was not
understood to be a way to raise a local menu.<br>
<br>
There are other areas for improvement as well. The dialogs to attach
"collectors" and "Attach" processes were not intuitive enough.&nbsp;
This was true of most all the dialogs.<br>
<br>
Also worth noting in the summary, the term "Collector" means nothing to
the user. While we've become educated to this term, when presenting it
to the user, they drew a blank. (The did however seem comfortable with
the 'experiment' concept.)<br>
<br>
Much other feedback and room for improvement were also
discovered.&nbsp; I've attempted to itemize them as action items below.
<br>
<br>
Please feel free to correct/add/delete anything you interpreted
differently.<br>
<br>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId729081"></a><a name="Issues"></a>Issues</h2>
<br>
1 - When loading the execuable and experiment from the command line, we
need to bring up the experiment directly. This was a major source of
confusion for 3 of the 4 candidates. I'm sure it would have been
confusing for 4 of 4 had the other candidate not come into
Open|SpeedShop and used the wizard to load the experiment.<br>
<br>
o One suggestion was to bring up the 'Summary wizard' page, with a
progress bar, then bring up the experiment panel.<br>
<br>
o Another suggestion is to bring up the experiment panel after the
experiment has been finished being instrumented.<br>
(Maybe with a dialog showing progress is being made and a status line
being displayed.)<br>
FIXED: current:OpenSpeedShop:191911a<br>
<br>
2 - When setting command line options (openss -f fred pcsamp) the GUI
should take hints from any failure that may of prevented the command
from being completed. While I'd rate this at a lower priority this
could help people from further frustration.<br>
PENDING: Partially implemented.<br>
<br>
3 - It's not clear that the user output is going to the shell window
where the openss command was issued. People expected it to go to the
CmdPanel when the gui is visible. <br>
<br>
4 - There should only be one cli. All candidates and observers agreed
it should be the CmdPanel when in GUI mode.<br>
FIXED: current:OpenSpeedShop:191911a<br>
<br>
5 - Cumulative percent should be removed from the pcsamp default
report. (As per a suggestion... I'll wait for feedback if&nbsp; others
agree with this comment.)<br>
FIXED:<br>
<br>
6 - "File-&gt;Save Experiment ..." needs better descriptive
wording.&nbsp; Also, since it's an overview window (the start of one
anyway) maybe it should be turned into a panel and the "File-&gt;Save
Experiment" functionaly should be hung off it.<br>
<br>
7 - When attaching a "collector" or process to an experiment, put the
current status somewhere. Possibilities may be a dialog box, or even in
the experiment window itself.<br>
<br>
8 - A feature addition: The user wants to be able to sort the
pcStatsPanel like we currently do. However they also want to select a
set of items (from the list) and only show them.<br>
<br>
9 - Change "Construct New Experiment" to "Custom Experiment"<br>
FIXED<br>
<br>
10- Allow the flexibility to change the tab name. (Experiment name)
Allow this from a menu option on the tab, or at the wizard interface.<br>
<br>
Martin adds:<br>
Should this change the name in all associated windows (if the main
experiment name becomes part of the tab names)? Also, should this be
part of the CLI as well, since ID won't make sense to the user anymore
once they exit the GUI? <br>
PARTIAL FIX: Supported in GUI not in cli<br>
<br>
11- Put the "Experiments" menu under the File-&gt;Experiments entry.<br>
FIXED:<br>
<br>
12- When bringing up a "fresh" experiment, put a "dialog" inito the
blank panel container that will help the user Load a
process/program/"collector".<br>
PARTIAL FIX: We now put a wizard in all 'blank' experiments, except the
Custom Experiment Panel. That panel is one-off and may need a separate
wizard panel...<br>
<br>
13- When loading an "collector" into an experiment, the dialog reads,
"Loading Executable"... it should be "Loading Experiment"<br>
FIXED:<br>
<br>
14- Add a "Window'-like entry to list the experiments that are
currently available to be raised in the gui.<br>
NOTE: The overview panel may be another approach.<br>
<br>
15- The "Open Saved Experiment" as well as the "Open Existing&nbsp;
Experiment" should create and raise the experiment directly rather than
requiring the use to take one more step to select the entry to be
raised.<br>
FIXED:<br>
<br>
16- Pet-peeve: Single click should highlight in the pcStatsPanel,
double click should raise the source. (Of course single vs double click
should be used consistently across the tool.)<br>
FIXED:<br>
<br>
17- The user should be able to do a rerun.&nbsp; The users commented
that they will run with one set of input paramaters, then they'll run
with a different set of parameters.&nbsp; They don't want to script
this, they simply want to change the arguments to their executable and
run again.<br>
<br>
18- BUG: opess -f "fred 1000" usertime ABORTS.<br>
FIXED: <br>
<br>
19- Allow selecting multiple entries off the Intro Wizard.<br>
<br>
20- Possibly put a 'Close' on the local panel menu.<br>
<br>
21- Need a source navigator.<br>
<br>
22- BUG: Save data to file when showing 2 experiments, and the&nbsp;
first entry was never run. Selects first experiment.... ABORT.<br>
FIXED:<br>
<br>
23- Try adding a icon bar, next to the 'x' that doesn menu, split
horizontal, split vertical, and 'x'. Change the icon menu to something
more obvious... maybe MS-Ladder...<br>
FIXED:<br>
<br>
24- Should we use the term 'Tab' instead of 'Panel'?<br>
<br>
25- BUG: Selecting Save Experiment but not selecting item causes ABORT.<br>
FIXED:<br>
<br>
26- The sort indicator in pcStatsPanel seems reversed.<br>
REJECTED: I checked with a designer example and the sort indicator is
as trolltech wants it...<br>
<br>
27- BUG: Update brings up pcStatsPanel.<br>
FIXED:<br>
<br>
28- Add tooltip regarding menus (i.e. "Right mouse button for context
sensitive menu.")<br>
FIXED:<br>
<br>
29- No intuitive way to delete a panel container. Possibly leave the
icon bar on an empty panel container.<br>
FIXED:<br>
<br>
30- BUG: Panel layout resize problem. Resize, split, then tried
removing the CmdPanel (or the PanelContainer the CmdPanel was in). Did
not<br>
resize/reposition correctly. (Actually in retrospect this may have
worked. If I remember correctly, the user may have shrunk the thumb
into a small area and this was being resized.... Hmmm.)<br>
PENDING: (Unable to reproduce.)<br>
<br>
31- "Managing Collectors and Process" still needs more help
understanding what it does. Suggests changing this to simply "Manager
Processes..."<br>
FIXED:<br>
<br>
32- "Collector" is an internal name. Use one that is more generic<br>
and meaningful. One suggestion was "Instrumentation."<br>
<br>
33- Possibly add an 'unsplit' menu option.<br>
<br>
34- "Attach Program" should be "Load Program" (Manage Collectors and
Processes)<br>
Fixed:<br>
<br>
35- "Detach Collector" should be "Remove Collector" -- Remember
"Collector" should be something different...<br>
<br>
36- Color for tabs experiment number. This is easier to show
association rather than [1] number. NOTE: The v menu option could be
used to easily show color association.<br>
FIXED:<br>
<br>
37- In the Intro Wizard add the actual experiment name after the more
wordy description.<br>
i.e. "I'm trying to find where my program is spending most of it's
time" should be:&nbsp; I'm trying to find where my program is spending
most of it's time. [pcsamp]<br>
FIXED:<br>
<br>
38- Make more consistent usage of the experiment terms. i.e. use
pcsamp, pc Sampling, pc Sample Experiment but don't mix them all.<br>
<br>
39- Finish - Load - Finish in the wizard, skip the last Finish.<br>
FIXED<br>
<br>
40- "Finish" to "Use Defaults"... (After thinking about this one, "Use
Defaults" would be confusing as it may be misleading that each page
would want that entry. I see Martin's issue, but would ask for a
different wording suggestion.<br>
<br>
Martin adds:<br>
I see the problem with "Use defaults"; that would be confusing.&nbsp;
What about keeping "Finish Wizard" and using this button to accept all
defaults that were not selected, yet, and then skip forward to the
experiment panel without asking for a binary or confirmation. Using the
"Finish Wizard" button right after selecting an experiment would then
be the same as just selecting the experiment without a wizard.<br>
FIXED:<br>
<br>
41- Intro Wizard Scrollbar. Move the scrollbar to the inner frame so
the buttons can be seen without scrolling the window.<br>
<br>
42- Bug: Source Panel, when it can't find source don't reposition the
'current' source.<br>
FIXED: mod current:OpenSpeedShop:192690a <br>
<br>
43- Run button status. When launching executable, change the status
first to "launching", "Paused - Ready to run", then to Running. Greying
the buttons as appropriate.<br>
<br>
44- Put a clock out on the run button (or some visible status area)
that ticks the wall clock time the executable is taking...<br>
<br>
45- Grey "Update Button" when loading from Saved File.<br>
<br>
46- Grey "Other buttons" when loading from Saved File.<br>
<br>
47- Make the Overview "Open Existing Experiment" a panel.<br>
<br>
48- (Make the "Manager Collectors and Processes" a panel.)<br>
<br>
49- Add a 'gather routine" for all associated panels. This would
basically pull all disjoint panels (with same expid) to one experiment
panel and locate the experiment int the top-level (focused)
window/frame.<br>
<br>
50- Also add a function to delete all the panels associated with an
experiment. Possibly add this to the 'close experiment dialog"<br>
Delete (expClose) the experiment?<br>
Selecting Yes will delete the experiment.<br>
Selecting No will close the window.<br>
[x] Close all related windows.<br>
[Yes] [No]<br>
<br>
51- When you restarted the GUI from the CLI, the GUI came as you left
it - it might be easier for the user, if you could open/raise the
experiment panel of the currently focused experiment. That's presumably
the experiment the user has worked on last and hence wants to see now.
Even better<br>
would be an optional argument to opengui that users can use to specify
an experiment (orthogonal to all other commands), but that's not a
comment for you alone anymore. <br>
<br>
52- Move Wizards to the File-&gt; menu.<br>
FIXED:<br>
<br>

<h2><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId67362"></a><a
 name="Other_comments_and_requests:"></a>Other comments and requests:</h2>
<br>
- HPC Toolkit<br>
I was asked to look at thie for tree display example. (Chip)<br>
<br>
- gprof callstacks <br>
I was asked to look at this for callgraph example. (Scott)<br>
<br>
- Multiprocess management<br>
In this case, the user was saying that he wanted a single tool that
allows him to do both serial and parallel performance analysis.&nbsp;
He would like it tbe able to do both gprof/prof type experiments&nbsp;
plus vampir type MPI tracing. He was saying that he was forced to use
pixie and totalview in the past, but it doesn't work as well as a
single tool would.<br>
<br>
- Wants one data file, not many. Wants to be able to compare one run to
another.<br>
<br>
- Better/Hierarchical source navigation (make all modules belonging to
one application visible) <br>
