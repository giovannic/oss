<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId474327"></a>General</h2>
We had 2 volunteers as SGI Eagan and 4 in Los Alamos.<br>
I'll type out my notes as I have them for each one and<br>
then try to distill the results into something we can<br>
act on.<br>
<br>

<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId934445"></a>Study Observations</h3>
12:55 start.<br>
<br>
"make" instruction was confusing. I need to "make clean"<br>
before each study.<br>
<br>
#3 - Task point<br>
<br>
Went to "man" immediately for invocation hints.<br>
<br>
Expected real "man" capabilities. (I will warn them in future)<br>
<br>
Need to put names on experiments types to make (?).<br>
<br>
Kept trying to do everything on a single line.<br>
<br>
Commands need to be listed by category.<br>
<br>
Move examples to beginning or at least point to them near<br>
the beginning of the man pages.<br>
<br>
"found symtab" message confusing. (this is a reoccurring issue)<br>
<br>
Not intuitive to use "help". (Need to make it clear in<br>
man pages.)<br>
<br>
#7 - Task point<br>
<br>
Expview not working as he expects. he's really confused,<br>
fumbling around trying in vain to get assignment done.<br>
<br>
User doesn't know that something is actually happening after<br>
they type expGo. They get the expID prompt back and think<br>
it is finished running.<br>
<br>
Need more words in the intro about the tool. My assumption<br>
was that they could read my mind and knew what a performance<br>
analysis tool was and that this was one.<br>
<br>
1:15<br>
<br>
Wants examples in manpage. (did I delete them? No I didn't)<br>
<br>
Thinks the command expEnable is needed.<br>
<br>
Parsing errors don't give information.<br>
<br>
Wants usage in brief output as opposed to how I currently<br>
dump it.<br>
<br>
Not obvious to use "help" for terminology. Doesn't expect<br>
terminology to accessed by the help facility.<br>
<br>
1:30<br>
<br>
expView pcsamp core dumped<br>
<br>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId807555"></a>DEBRIEFING:</h3>
<br>
Some commands such as help and the list commands need to<br>
be synchronous.<br>
<br>
Need some indication when process ended.<br>
<br>
Available views output from listViews need more annotation.<br>
<br>
Sample session request. Full sequence in examples.<br>
<br>
Expected terminology to be defined in man page.<br>
<br>
"Anything enclosed in &lt;&gt; can be accessed by Help" should<br>
be spelled in the fluff part of a help response for a<br>
command.<br>
<br>
The connection between listView and viewTypes isn't intuitive.<br>
<br>
<br>

(sgi)</h2>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId230679"></a>Study Observations</h3>
2:12 start<br>
<br>
Tell users that this not a real manpage.<br>
<br>
Not obvious that -cli is needed.<br>
<br>
After invoking experiment, unclear when things are started<br>
or done.<br>
<br>
Al has old version of man page.<br>
<br>
There is no hook back to the command that uses an experiment<br>
like "help usertime".<br>
<br>
Wants vanilla "run the experiment and give me a view".<br>
<br>
Keeps having to escape openss in order to get further<br>
on because steps are not obvious.<br>
<br>
2:30<br>
<br>
Figured out up to expGo and uses listStatus effectively.<br>
<br>
Having trouble figuring out how to display data.<br>
<br>
Expview without argument just fivs "parse error" and<br>
doesn't give any clue to what was wrong.<br>
<br>
Typed '?' to get help.<br>
<br>
"help listViews" tried to get info on how to dump profile.<br>
Doesn't help.<br>
<br>
Doesn't know what an "&lt;expID_spec&gt;" is.<br>
<br>
"expView usertime" had async parse. (?)<br>
<br>
2:42<br>
<br>
Wants to save output screen for comparison.<br>
<br>
Does not realize there are 2 pages to assignment.<br>
<br>
Doesn't know how to find out what the definition<br>
or terminology is. Keeps looking for it in the man<br>
pages.<br>
<br>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId611644"></a>DEBRIEFING:</h3>
<br>
It would be nice to get full recursive grammar again for<br>
a command.<br>
<br>
BNF notation is not intuitive.<br>
<br>
"expParam -x 1 pcsamp::sampling_rate=5" gets a parsing<br>
error at '1'<br>
<br>
3:00<br>
<br>
Done.<br>
<br>
#######################################################<br>
Musings after Lori leaves:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; We should define what an experiment is in terms<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; of commands. Describe a typical session roadmap.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) expCreate<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Initial definition of an
experiment. Application<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; and data model.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) expAttach<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allows the user to include more
attributes to a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; predefined experiment.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) expGo<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experiment has been completely
defined and is to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; be run.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) expView<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell tool you want to look at the
results that have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; been collected.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5) exit<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit openss.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
#######################################################<br>
On the road I change the manpage to say something<br>
about using the help command and reformat the command<br>
summary information there as well.<br>
<br>
I start to change how the parsing error messages behave<br>
but it turns out that there are too many changes this<br>
late in the game so I chicken out.<br>

<br>
9:18<br>
Made and ran fred.<br>
<br>
Went to man page.<br>
<br>
Man page is not clear about using -cli in the examples.<br>
<br>
Typed commands and nothing seemed to happen.<br>
<br>
Back to manpage to figure out how to get to step #5.<br>
<br>
Syntax error. Back to man page.<br>
<br>
Trying to associate fred with experiment. Not clear what has happened.<br>
<br>
Another expCreate.<br>
<br>
Exited openss and tries again.<br>
<br>
There is no connection between the experiment id and expGo<br>
so he makes another blank experiment followed by an expGo<br>
and nothing is there to run.<br>
<br>
exited again and started and stopped fred out side of openss.<br>
Got pid of fred. Opened openss; GUI! Exited and openss -cli.<br>
<br>
Attached to fred.<br>
<br>
9:37<br>
<br>
ListViews -&gt; nothing.<br>
<br>
Back to man page and examples and available commands.<br>
<br>
I gave hint about "help"<br>
<br>
Looked expCreate.<br>
<br>
Exits and goes back to manpage. Opens another window<br>
so he can look at manpage while within openss.<br>
<br>
Backgrounds fred again and pens openss with -p option (usertine).<br>
<br>
Got listStatus and listViews working.<br>
<br>
expGo. expView -&gt; "parsing error".<br>
<br>
9:48<br>
<br>
Got a result!<br>
<br>
#6 - task point<br>
<br>
listStatus -&gt; started running with large number for fred.<br>
<br>
Feels need to quit in order to stop and try again.<br>
<br>
Still starting fred outside of oss and stopping job, getting<br>
pid and then "openss -cli -p &lt;pid&gt;"<br>
<br>
Going through experiment again.<br>
<br>
Repeated expView.<br>
<br>
Waiting for fred to end.<br>
<br>
Most time thought to be inclusive time. (thought init took<br>
the longest time).<br>
<br>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId38288"></a>DEBRIEFING:</h3>
<br>
Wants a lot of examples. Abstract.<br>
<br>
Expects "openss -cli -f fred usertime" to run and display result.<br>
<br>
Would go to gui initially.<br>
<br>
Notification of the fact the experiment was created would be nice.<br>
<br>
-cli should be defaulted for a commandline tool.<br>
<br>
Print out next steps that would be appropriate.<br>
<br>
DPCL in hung and we can't get out of openss after<br>
attaching to ksh. (exit should cut all ties)<br>
<br>
Asynchronous returns are confusing.<br>
<br>
<br>

Still reading expSave help<br>

<br>
listFocus -&gt; syntax error -&gt; how does one know what is failing?<br>
<br>
expEnable all, " expList" -&gt; syntax error<br>
<br>
* Somehow space prepended to command causes syntax problems.<br>
<br>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId934419"></a>DEBRIEFING:</h3>
<br>
Really thinks his problem is "enabling".<br>
<br>
The expView brief explanation does not tell us that this<br>
is how one gets the display of the experiment result.<br>
<br>
Have a hint in the commands help to use help for syntax.<br>
<br>
Definition of terms.<br>
<br>
Use something like gnuplot.<br>
<br>
Need examples.<br>
<br>
List commands more in order of use.<br>
<br>
In help, list related commands and terms.<br>
<br>
Doesn't like "exp*", like expCreate. Would prefer "exp *,<br>
like exp Create.<br>
<br>
In the manpage, the second paragraph of the description needs<br>
to redone.<br>
<br>
Please ship with tutorial.<br>
<br>
apropos command request (second request for this).<br>
<br>
Default viewtype request.<br>
<br>
What is viewtype? Not Obvious.<br>

1:34<br>
Reads through the whole usability task instructions.<br>
<br>
Does a make. Looks at the source files, runs fred and<br>
times it.<br>
<br>
man openss -&gt; Reads the manpage and looks for examples.<br>
<br>
Figures out expAttach is not needed for fred.<br>
<br>
Prefers GUI normally.<br>
<br>
openss -f fred pcsamp -&gt; opens another shell for manpage.<br>
<br>
Looking for example that will show how to run program.<br>
Tries expGO.<br>
<br>
Needs more information about categories.<br>
<br>
Thought expGo did nothing and then was surprised when the<br>
result popped up. Would like to have been told that it<br>
was running.<br>
<br>
listMetrics -&gt; pcsamp::time<br>
<br>
Goes through the other list commands guessing what sampling<br>
rate is.<br>

Remarks that "list" commands should have displayed experiment<br>
data.<br>

<br>
Keyboard history request. (ie. review and edit previously<br>
typed in commands like within a shell)<br>
<br>
"expView -help" expected.<br>
<br>
Parsing error should print out grammar and request<br>
for the user to use -help &lt;command&gt;.<br>

Confused what "focus" is.<br>
<br>
Finds usertime (exclusive/inclusive)<br>
<br>
help usertime:exclusivetime -&gt; parse error.<br>
<br>
Wants explicit example of most common experiment.<br>
<br>
Make manpage longer. Add examples in categories.<br>
<br>
Will use user guide AFTER success with tool.<br>
<br>
Bang escape to shell feature not needed.<br>
<br>
Wants prompt to stand out more so it will delimit between<br>
other output.<br>
<br>
Prompt only for input command typing.<br>

Use a "more/less" for long output. Better yet shorten<br>

Glanced through instructions, make, looks at source,<br>

<br>
Is it possible to use both -f and -p?<br>
What would it mean?<br>
<br>
Figures out what "experiments" mean and<br>
are called.<br>
<br>
Doesn't show how to change pcsampling rate. How does<br>
one do this?<br>
<br>
Reads over manpage very carefully. Wants to know what the<br>
tool can do.<br>
<br>
No "-cli" in examples is confusing.<br>
<br>
openss -cli -f fred pcsamp. Now what?<br>

listExp -&gt; returns '1', but thinks it's 'l'. No connection<br>
between return value and expID.<br>

expGo -&gt; confuse with asynchronous return.<br>

Doubting self at this point.<br>

expFocus 1.<br>

<br>
#8<br>
<br>
Not sure what to save. help expSave: 4th paragraph<br>
"operations". Whole expSave help/manpage needs to<br>
be rewritten.<br>
<br>
What is file_spec? Guesses wrong.<br>
<br>
Up/Down keys don't work.<br>
<br>
What is &lt;file_spec&gt;?<br>
<br>
database is one word.<br>
<br>
expSave help is too long. Scrolling would help.<br>

manpages -&gt; where is file_spec?<br>
<br>
expSave 1 fred -&gt; gives extra spaces before parsing failed.<br>

prepended space problem in parser.<br>

#9<br>
<br>
Why are the command names using inconsistent spelling<br>
conventions?<br>
<br>
expSetParam and expSetParm&nbsp; work with help. Only one<br>
should be used.<br>
<br>
No help for ListParms. Don't know ListParams.<br>
<br>
listParms -&gt; pcsamp::sampling_rate. Huh?<br>
What is ::sampling_rate.<br>
<br>
expSetParm does not parse double colon (::) options.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId260093"></a>DEBRIEFING:</h3>
<br>
<br>
How does one know if the sampling_rate changed or whatever<br>
it is?<br>
<br>
Why is there not a default view!<br>
<br>
listParms should state what the default is.<br>
<br>
The sampling unit should always be the same. Milliseconds<br>
for example.<br>
<br>
Delays after commands for simple test case is confusing.<br>
Why the delay?<br>
<br>
Why doesn't "exit" preempt everything and just close down<br>
everything?<br>
<br>
Add status to prompt for focused experiment.<br>
<br>
Add an overall status command that prints out the<br>
list* options for each of the experiments. I is tedious<br>
to search for the correct list command when one really<br>
wants to know the full current status and what the<br>
logical next steps would be.<br>
<br>
User application stdout/stderr dumping into redirected file.<br>
Separate grabbing of stdout/stderr. Make it configurable.<br>
<br>
ListStatus all-&gt; should identify the expid.<br>
<br>
Maybe take out assignments in documentation. It will make<br>
people want to use it. This is in regards to our python<br>
like cli. Unless we are going to get it bullet proof and<br>
documented for the beta we should not advertise it in<br>
our static and runtime documentation.<br>
