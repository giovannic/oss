To run this test manually in this directory, do:

./runone-dpcl

This will activate the ..../current/test/test_scripts/runone-dpcl 
script which looks for *.tst files in the dpcl directories and
executes them.   There is an expected results file: data_type.tst.expected
which is compared with the data_type.tst.output file.   If they
match the testresults file reports PASSED otherwise it reports failed.

This test was adapted from Bill's original build and run scripts and files.
