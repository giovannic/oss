Written by:
Chai-Yan Wong

SUPPORTING FILES: 

 	Makefile.eut_diag -- make file, Used to build the end user tool.
	eut_diag.C  -- main source file.
	sample.output -- sample output file.

PURPOSE:

	This tool will periodically (every 4 seconds) print the values of the
	those global variables that have changed.

GENERAL FORMAT:
	$ eut_diag <host name> pid <pid>
		OR
	$ eut_diag <host name> path </full path/executable
			<additional poe args ...>
		*specify "d" for <host name> to use default host


NOTES:
	1) The file, sample.output, shows what can be expected as output.  It 
	was generated by running eut_diag against a program named samplempi
	(running 4 ways) with one global value that changes (num_msgs).
