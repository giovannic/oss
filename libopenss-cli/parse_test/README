To build and run the parser tests you will
need to set some environment variables.
Under tcsh here is how I do it:

    setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /home/jcarter/workarea/bits/lib
    setenv OPENSS_PLUGIN_PATH /home/jcarter/workarea/bits/lib/openspeedshop

You will need to change the above paths to fit
your installation.

Basically I am linking in the dso libopenss-cli.so
to get to the openss parser.

Then you need to do the following:

    make -f parse_test.make
    gen_input

Then loop through all the input files creating
output files. Here is how it is done in tcsh:

    foreach file (`cat file.list`)
    	echo ""
    	echo $file
    	./parser $file.input > $file.input.out
    end

To compare the results against checkedin results:

    foreach file (`cat file.list`)
    	echo ""
    	echo $file
    	diff $file.input.out $file.output > $file.diff
    end

All the diff files should be empty.

You should be able to:
    grep -i syntax
or 
    grep -i error

all the *.input.out files without having a hit.
