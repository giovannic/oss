The <b>Open|SpeedShop</b><small><sup>TM</sup></small> Interactive Command Line Interface Library, known elsewhere
simply as the CLI, provides support for interactive, batch, and python
command interface required for the <b>Open|SpeedShop</b><small><sup>TM</sup></small>
performance tool to interface with the user.  The Graphical User Interface (GUI) 
also depends on this CLI library for it's command processing.  Most of the GUI 
gestures result in the passing of a CLI command through the CLI interface 
and subsequently to the Framework library interface.  The Framework library API 
has helped facilitate the creation of 
<b>Open|SpeedShop</b><small><sup>TM</sup></small>'s user interfaces. 

@section MainPage_S1 How to Use This Documentation

These pages have been generated directly from the CLI's source code. As
such they are <em>the</em> definitive guide to the CLI. However since the
size of the CLI is large, and thus its documentation is also, simply
jumping to the individual class descriptions may be overwhelming.  To simplify
things, the various entity's have been categorized into "modules" - each
of which has its own overview page that describes that aspect of the CLI.

If you are interested in information about a particular class, file, etc., it is
best to use the links at the top of this page to quickly jump to that entity's
documentation.
