To build the scripting API documentation and fill
out the package as it currently stands:

    source doit.csh

The documentation will be deposited in the 
directory doc. Just point your browser at
doc/index.html.

Don't have epydoc? Google it and download sources 
from SourceForge and build it. Pretty easy. For our
official distribution I will have the documentation 
pregenerated for download or accessable from our 
official OpenSpeedShop URL.

To build the dummy OpenSpeedShop dso for the 
scripting package read oss/README.

I have some stand alone tests scripts in ./test.
They cover each of the commands in terms of parsing
and passing to the OpenSpeedShop dso parser, but
do not yet work with the full OpenSpeedShop tool.
They will however, give one a feel for what I've
done with the API and let people get a chance to
scream early on.
