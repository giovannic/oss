To build and run the parser tests you will
need to set some environment variables.
Under tcsh here is how I do it:

    setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /home/jcarter/workarea/bits/lib
    setenv OPENSS_PLUGIN_PATH /home/jcarter/workarea/bits/lib/openspeedshop

You will need to change the above paths to fit
your installation.

If your installation of python2.3 is not at /usr/include/python2.3,
you will need to alter the INCLUDE_DIR in the makefile
to reflect that.

Basically I am linking in the dso libopenss-cli.so
to get to the openss parser.

Then you need to do the following:

    make -f script_test.make

You should get a dso named script_test.so.

Then go to the test directory:

    cd ../test

Make soft link to directory where we have our oss module:

    ln -s ../oss

Now you should be able to run any of the tests
under python. For example:

    python expCreate.py

The result will be a dump of the command from
the internal ParseResult object within the OpenSpeedShop
parser.
